<h3>The Email That Started This Project</h3>
<hr/>
<p>Hi Friends,</p>

<p>Wait! Before you leave this conversation because it is a big message with a lot of recipients whose names you don’t recognize, I want to say that I hand-selected each of you because I thought that you would be an excellent participant for this practice.</p>

<p>That said, I want to propose something to you all (and whoever else you think would be interested.) I propose to you: The Practice of Common Reading.</p>

<p><b>Proposition:</b></p>

<p>It’s quite simple. The Practice of Common Reading will be facilitated by the following structure that I plan to put in place: I will make a simple daily/weekly schedule with corresponding reading selections from a given book. The schedule will slowly progress through a book selected by majority vote. Books will be proposed, the proposed books will be voted on, and the book with the most votes will be selected. Additionally, I plan to operate both via email and facebook message. If you think your friend would be interested, but they do not have a facebook, “Do not fear” I can add them to the email chain.</p>

<p>Books are to be proposed based on how conducive they are to contributing to one’s spiritual growth. The books could be Bible books or fiction/nonfiction literature written by Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Leo Tolstoy, Dallas Willard, Charles Dickens, Victor Hugo, Jean Vanier, Thomas Merton, N.T. Wright, C.S. Lewis, etc.</p>

<p>Convinced? If not, feel free to read the following benefits I have verbalized below:</p>

<p><b>Benefits:</b></p>

<ul>
	<li>Random thoughts become relevant thoughts - If you come across a thought that you want to discuss with a thoughtful and friendly voice, then, rather than bringing it up to a random friend, you can share it with a person who already has a vested interest in the topic.</li>
	<li>Individual growth can become Common growth – Instead of making the journey of growth alone and in solitude, this system sets a structure in place where growth can be experienced alongside brothers and sisters of a like maturity.</li>
	<li>Individual growth does not have to suffer – The plan is to make the common reading a reasonable quantity of reading that is not demanding. It will, ideally, be very easy to keep up-to-pace with the schedule. But that does not mean that you have to always read through books slowly. Common Reading for common growth will be done slowly. Personal reading for personal growth can be done as fast as you wish.</li>
	<li>There is little to no commitment required of participants – This structure is not dependent on the participation of other readers. You can choose to read one book, then choose to skip the next five, and then choose to continue reading in common. At worst, Tommy Gehrig will be reading through a book alone at the scheduled pace. At best, Tommy Gehrig, each of his friends, and each of his friends’ friends will be reading through the same book at a common, scheduled pace.</li>
	<li>This system is incredibly inclusive – Because there are no commitments built into this system for participants, participants don’t have to be in communication with each other. The implication of this is that reading schedules can be shared with anyone. If a friend of mine sees that I’ve made a schedule for the Chronicles of Narnia, and he/she remembers that they wanted to read through the books with another friend of theirs, then they can share the schedule with their friend and the two of them can read the books independently of anyone receiving this message.</li>
	<li>Common Reading gives friends a good reason to meet up – Whether it be in a one-on-one setting or a group discussion setting, common reading would give friends a good platform of shared influential topics and ideas.</li>
</ul>

<p>I have attached the first schedule to this massage/email. The first book I have chosen is the book of Luke.</p>

<p>Feel free to leave this conversation if you are simply uninterested and feel free to invite people you think would absolutely be interested. (If you are getting this in the form of an email, reply if you don’t want to receive future email… or give me email addresses of those you think would be interested.</p>

<p>The last thing I’ll say is this: This is an experiment of sorts. I want to commit to reading through 3 books using this format. It could be that this falls flat, or it could be that there are profound positive effects induced by this practice. I expect there to be ways to improve this structure. Feel free to dialogue with me if you have ideas that you feel will improve how I structure this system.</p>

<p>I love you all and look forward to growing with you all in the practice of common reading.</p>

<br/>
Till later.<br/>
Peace.<br/><br/>
